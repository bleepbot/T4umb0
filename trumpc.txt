TrumpC explenation and vision



This is my first attempt to make the logic a bit better. 
 and how i'm doing it. basically just take a random tweet that you like and break it down as best as you can



#Hillary 	is attempting 	to take  our       freedom     to     bear arms 

[target]	[istryn]	[toba]	[ouryour]  [rifre]    [to]     [values]

			[is]+[trying]	[to]+[ba] 		




so this is set up that if in any sentance we want to use "is" we just call it up as #is# because then it won't sounds ugly when we want to do other things, this can be useful in the way like





#gop		is trying	to take back	your	right	to affordable health care

[support] [istryn] [toga] [ouryour] [rifre] [to] [values]

					[to]+[ga]




with only two changes we can add a positive message using most of the same tags.
